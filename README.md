# Heart Disease Prediction and Clustering

This repository focuses on the prediction and clustering of heart disease risk using a dataset of patient features. The project utilizes machine learning techniques like K-Means clustering, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to explore and visualize multi-dimensional data. 

## Project Overview

The dataset contains 14 variables about patients' heart health, including features like age, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate, and more. The primary objectives of the project are:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Clustering:** Using K-Means clustering to group patients into clusters based on their heart health data.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Using PCA and t-SNE to reduce the number of features for better visualization and interpretability of the data.
4. **Visualization:** Generating 2D, 3D, and 4D visualizations to represent the relationships between different features and clusters.

## Features

- **Heart Disease Dataset:** Contains various medical attributes for patients with heart disease.
- **K-Means Clustering:** A machine learning algorithm used to categorize patients into risk clusters.
- **PCA and t-SNE:** Used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive 2D, 3D, and 4D plots using Plotly and Matplotlib.
